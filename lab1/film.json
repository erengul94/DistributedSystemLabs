A film data structure is made of the following fields:
▪ id: unique identifier of the film data structure in the Film manager service
(mandatory); +
▪ title: textual title of the film (mandatory); +
▪ owner: the id of the film data structure owner, i.e., the user who created it
(mandatory);+
=======================================
▪ private: a mandatory Boolean property, set to true if the film data structure is
marked as private, false if it is public (default value: true). A film data structure is
said private if only its owner can access it, public if every user can access it;

▪ watchDate: the date when the film was watched by the owner, expressed in the
YYYY-MM-DD format (YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day). This
property can be included in the film data structure only if private is true;

▪ rating: a non-negative integer number (maximum 10) expressing the rating the
owner has given to the film. This property can be included in the film data structure
only if private is true;

▪ favorite: a Boolean property, set to true if that film is among the favourite ones of
the user, false otherwise (default value: false). This property can be included in the
film data structure only if private is true.
